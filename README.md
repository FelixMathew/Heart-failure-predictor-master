### 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart failure based on key medical indicators. It is a **binary classification model** built using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with a linear kernel — ideal for handling small but high-dimensional datasets.
